        <p>Hi there! My name is Nathan Cox and I am a cybersecurity professional, bringing over 20 years of experience as an automotive technician to the table.
As a driven and dedicated individual, I am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow. After two decades in the automotive industry, I am now ready to take on a new adventure and develop my skills in the field of cybersecurity.
Making a career change at 40 years old is no small feat, but I believe that it's never too late to follow your passions and make a positive impact. That's why I am determined to succeed in this new field and share my journey.
Here, you'll find my experiences, challenges, and insights as I navigate this new career path. My goal is to inspire and encourage others who may be considering a career change at any stage of their life.
Thank you for visiting my page and I hope you enjoy following my journey as I make a difference in the world of cybersecurity.</p>
